# ❄️ SnowC2: Snow Cover Heterogeneity and Its Impact on the Climate and Carbon Cycle of Arctic Regions

## 🌐 Overview

The **[SnowC2 project](https://climate.esa.int/en/about-us-new/fellowships/esa-cci-research-fellowship-Mickael-Lalande/)** is part of an [ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Research Fellowship](https://climate.esa.int/en/about-us-new/fellowships/) awarded to **Mickaël Lalande** and hosted at **Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR)** under the supervision of **Christophe Kinnard** and **Alexandre Roy** (RIVE / GLACIOLAB, Trois-Rivières, Canada), in collaboration with **Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)**.

The goal of SnowC2 is to improve our understanding of the **spatial heterogeneity of snow cover in Arctic regions** and its representation in process-based models, enabling more robust simulations of **snow cover, surface energy, and carbon fluxes** under current and future climate conditions.

## ⚡ Two Phases of SnowC2

### 1️⃣ Phase 1 – 1D Model Development and Evaluation

* Focus: **Enhancing the 1D physics of the CLASSIC (v1.8) snow model** for Arctic snowpacks with in situ assessment.
* Paper: *"Improving the CLASSIC (v1.8) Snow Model to Better Simulate Arctic Snowpacks"* (Lalande et al., in prep, to be submitted to [GMD](https://gmd.copernicus.org/)).
* **Code:** [CLASSIC-SnowC2-1D](https://github.com/mickaellalande/CLASSIC-SnowC2-1D/tree/SnowC2-1D)
* **This repo:** Contains scripts for **analyses, validation, and figure generation** ([CLASSIC/in_situ/](https://github.com/mickaellalande/SnowC2/tree/main/CLASSIC/in_situ)).

### 2️⃣ Phase 2 – 2D Spatial Simulations Across the Arctic

* Focus: **Large-scale Arctic simulations** with improved **snow cover fraction (SCF) parameterizations**.
* Goal: Evaluate spatial heterogeneity impacts on **surface energy and carbon fluxes** using Snow CCI datasets.
* *(Details will be updated in this repository as this work progresses.)*
