Ref: 20 cm peat (as adviced by Gesa + Brampton Dakin) -> but irrealistic soil temperatures and soil water content
-> 1 peat layer provides better results (with still too much water content in the first 10 cm but not much impact on winter soil temperatures)
-> changing the % of CLAY and SAND does not change much the results
-> no peat gives good water content but irrealistic summer soil temperatures (does not indirectly represent the moss/lichen)

Ref2 -> 1 peat with noleap forcing from Gesa -> slight differences but I'll still keep the forcing of Dutch et al. (2022): https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/16/4201/2022/

Then final run -> 1peat + forcing of Dutch et al. (2022)

later improved forcing from the paper of Georgina will follow with a datapaper, but that will be too late for my study
